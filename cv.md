## About me
 I am 25 years old. I graduated BSU (Chemiсal Faculty) and BSEU (Master's Degree in economics).  I work in the Ministry of antimonopoly regulation and trade. But I want to discover new opportunities for myself. So I have started to learn Javascript.
 My goal is to gain knowledge in the field of front-end development.

 **My strengths**:
  - Quick learner
  - Diligence
  - Responsibility
  - Team playing

> Don't stop there

## Code Examples
**Kata from Codewars**: The task is to create the function isDivideBy (or is_divide_by) to check if an integer number is divisible by both integers a and b.

```
    function isDivideBy(number, a, b) {
    if (Number.isInteger(number/a)&&(Number.isInteger(number/b))) {
      return true 
    } else {
      return false
      }
  }
  ```
