## About me
 I am 26 years old. I graduated BSU (Chemiсal Faculty) and BSEU (Master's Degree in economics).  I worked in the Ministry of antimonopoly regulation and trade, and now I'm on maternity leave.
 I am not satisfied with my life now and I want to change this. I completed RS Schools Course «JavaScript/Front-end. Stage 0»  and started stage 1 in the beggining of 2022, but didn't finished, and now I am trying to take it again, havemore time to learn and practice Javascript.
 In my mind, self-discipline and practice is the key to success.
 My goal is to be a front-end developer when I graduate RS Schools Course «JavaScript/Front-end. 2022Q3».

 **My strengths**:
  - Quick learner
  - Diligence
  - Responsibility
  - Team playing

## Code Examples
**Kata from Codewars**: The task is to create the function isDivideBy (or is_divide_by) to check if an integer number is divisible by both integers a and b.

```
    function isDivideBy(number, a, b) {
    if (Number.isInteger(number/a)&&(Number.isInteger(number/b))) {
      return true 
    } else {
      return false
      }
  }
  ```
